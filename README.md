A compiled spreadsheet about Windows11 23H2 services.

As of 24/02/2024, the sheet is not yet complete. 

A lot of testing and breaking stuff takes place to fill the list up which takes a lot of time. If you wish to correct something that is wrong or anything of that nature, feel free to reach out and i will do the necessary changes.

Some of the info that is in the spreadsheet might not be 100% accurate, especially the "what it breaks section" or the description of the service. There is always gonna be more and more things to add, especially after windows updates.

Thank you and God bless.

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
